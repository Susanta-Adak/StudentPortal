# StudentPortal
The aim of this project is to build a RESTful API for a student portal using Node.js, Express, 
MongoDB, JWT authentication/authorization and documenting using Swagger.

The API will provide endpoints for various functionalities related to the student portal, such as:

* User registration and login
* Course registration and management
* Assignment submission and grading
* Forum discussion and posting

The API will be secured using JWT authentication and authorization, 
with different levels of access for different user roles.
Only authenticated and authorized users will be able to access certain endpoints.

The API will be documented using Swagger, providing clear and concise information about the endpoints, 
request and response parameters, and example requests and responses.
